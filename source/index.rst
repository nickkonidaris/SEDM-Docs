Welcome to SED Machine's documentation!
=======================================

The SED Machine is very low resolution (:math:`\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}\sim100`) optical (365 - 1,000 nm) integral field (30"x"30") spectrograph and a rainbow imager with a 10' x 10' field. The rainbow camera images are partitioned into u, g, r, and i bands, each with a 5' x 5' field of view. The instrument was designed for rapid classification of supernova from PTF. To achieve this goal, the instrument was designed to be:

- Spectral resolution :math:`R=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}\sim100`, sufficient for classification.
- High "Slit to detector" photon throughput.
- 0.1 mag precision spectrophotometry.

The hardware project was funded by the NSF with a grant to Caltech and executed by Nick Konidaris (Principle Investigator), Robert Quimby (Project Scientist), Jack Davis, and Sagi Ben-Ami (Weizzman institute grad student). 

Here we document the instrument for observers from simple users to the developer.
